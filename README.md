MultiTouchGUIP5
===============

This a template to build multitouch apps with processing.org. The architecture is a simplistic MVC, with a touch facade, implemented only with TUIO and mouse.

Using Maven, I can't find processing.org libraries in maven repos, hacked for compile with integrated libraries src/main/lib/... , :(
